# NatureDestructionSpeed
Author: Huy Pham    | Finished on March 13 2021

The main purpose of this small project is to raise people awareness of how fast we are destroying our planet and encourage people to collaborate on making Earth a better place for all species.

Although this website is still a little bit 'clumsy', I am very happy to participate in taking actions protecting our Earth.

Thank you.
